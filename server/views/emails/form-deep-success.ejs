<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  We have received your registration information for the <b>City Retreat Summer 2023: The Deep End</b>!
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
    The deep end is the deepest part of a body of water, which can initially be a scary place filled with unknowns and things unseen,
    but eventually leads to amazing scenes and experiences. Going into the deep end 
    with Jesus means that as we trust in Him and know that He’s with us,
    we then get to know Him more intimately and be filled with His unconditional love
    that sets us free and refreshes our souls. 
    This is our prayer for City Ministry - for us to grow in our intimacy with Jesus so
    that we can invest in Biblical community, influence others, and impact the city with the Gospel.
    Join us for our City Ministry retreat where we will learn about what it means to be in the deep end with Jesus!

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    The retreat will start on the evening of Friday, July 21, and end during the night of Saturday, July 22 at  Silvermine Beach Resort, Mui Wo.
