  We have received your registration information for With Everything
  Congregational Retreat on February 25-27, 2022 at YMCA Wu Kai Sha!
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  The congregational retreat will span over the course of 3 days and two nights
  (staying over at Wu Kai Sha YMCA). Together as a church, we will seek God’s
  heart through His word and worship together as a congregation. We believe God
  will meet us and speak to us powerfully as we learn more about what it means
  to worship God with everything we have.
