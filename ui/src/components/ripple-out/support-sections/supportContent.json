Here is a sample prayer to guide you in this process: “Lord, I pray that you would move my heart and show me how You are calling me to be a part of Your kingdom work in Hong Kong. Give me faith so that I can respond with generosity and give with joy by faith as I believe that you’ll multiply and provide for Your church. May it be more of you and we pray that you will use this new facility for your glory to saturate the city. Amen”"
