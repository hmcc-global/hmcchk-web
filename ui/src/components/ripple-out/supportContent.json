We aren’t all in the same place financially, but sacrificial giving is an element of Christian faith. In Mark 12:41, the widow gave everything she had and Christ commended her though her gift was only a small amount. It’s not just about the amount, but it comes down to stretching ourselves as we give by faith towards what God is calling us to."
