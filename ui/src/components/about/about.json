    "blurb": "Harvest Mission Community Church of Hong Kong is an international church planted in 2015, when a team of 20 people came with a vision to reach this great city and be a 1st-century church in the 21st century. We want to be a church that is transcultural, with people from all walks of life and backgrounds."

    "0": "After the first church started at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, God gave us a vision to plant churches on campuses in cities all around the world. We have started churches in Austin, Detroit, and Jakarta, and now Hong Kong, when a team of 20 people came to start HMCC of Hong Kong with a vision to reach this great city and be a 1st-century church in the 21st century.",
    "1": "As an international church that is for the city, we value transculturalism and we are actively reaching out to people from all walks of life, specifically university students, working adults, and families. We want to reach students in the university campuses around Hong Kong because we believe that university is a pivotal time for people to discover their God-given destiny. We are also reaching out to working adults and families so that they can be the salt and light of this city in their spheres of influence.",
    "2": "It is our passion for the local church to continue to be a viable demonstration of His love, seeing more people radically changed through the Gospel, trained to be a Christ disciple, and sent out to other nations to be the light unto the world. Our longer term vision is the BOLD Vision, where we want to Build 1 School of Ministry, Open 1 site locally & 1 church globally, Launch at least 1 LIFE Group on each of the university campuses and regions of Hong Kong, and Disciple 1,000 people through the ALIVE training curriculum.",
    "3": "God continues to write our story and we cannot wait to see how it will unfold. One thing that we do know is that our vision will always remain the same. We desire to see people’s lives transformed, redirected to God’s purposes, and set out to transform the world for the glory of God."

      "7": "We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, and that every local church has the right under Christ to decide and govern its own affairs.",
      "8": "We believe that water baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances to be observed by the Church during the present age. They are, however, not to be regarded as means of salvation."
