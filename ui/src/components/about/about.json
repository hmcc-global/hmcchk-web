    "0": "After the first church started on the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, God gave us a vision to plant churches on college campuses in global cities all around the world. We have started churches in Austin, Detroit, Jakarta and Singapore. Then, in July of 2015, a team of 20 people came to Hong Kong to start HMCC of Hong Kong with a vision to reach this great city and be a 1st-century church in the 21st century.",
    "1": "As we are an international church that is for the city, we value transculturalism and we are actively reaching out to people from all walks of life, specifically college students, working adults, and families. We want to reach college students in the university campuses around Hong Kong because we believe that college is a pivotal time for people to discover their God-given destiny. We are also reaching out to single adults and families so that they can be the salt and light of this city in their spheres of influence.",
    "2": "It is our passion and desire for the local church to continue to be the visible display and viable demonstration of His love, seeing more people radically changed through the Gospel, trained, and sent out to other nations to be the light unto the world. Our longer term vision for the next 5 years is the BOLD Vision, we want to Build 1 School of Ministry, Open 1 site locally & 1 church globally, Launch at least 1 LIFE Group on each of the university campuses and regions of Hong Kong, and Disciple 1,000 people through the ALIVE training curriculum.",
    "3": "God continues to write our story and we cannot wait to see how it will unfold. One thing that we do know is that our vision will always remain the same. We desire to see people’s lives transformed, redirected to God’s purposes, and set out to transform the world for the glory of God."
